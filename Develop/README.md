  This package runs in the terminal.You will need to install node.JS and the inquirer package.
  
  
## Usage
 When the user types node index into the command line, they are presented with a series of questions, which will ask them information about their application. This includes, a description of the application, the usage of the application, installation steps, contributors, the license which was used, screenshots and their contact information. Once the users answers all the questions a README file is generated.

 The user will have a list of licenses to pick from and once they select their license, the link to that licenses website will be automatically added to the README and a badge with the license will be displayed at the top of the README.
